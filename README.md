# @launchql/mcp-server

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps you use LaunchQL platform tools better and easier with AI agents.

## Setup

To run the LaunchQL MCP server using npx, use the following command:

```bash
npx -y @launchql/mcp-server@latest
```

## Usage with Cursor or Claude Desktop

Add the following configuration. For more information, read the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) or the [Claude Desktop MCP guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "launchql-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@launchql/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, you might need to use this alternative configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "launchql-mcp-server": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/k", "npx", "-y", "@launchql/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Build the project and copy prompts to build directory
- `pnpm clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm inspector` - Run the MCP inspector with the server
- `pnpm format` - Format code using Biome
- `pnpm lint` - Lint code using Biome

### Available Tools

The server provides the following tools:

| Tool Name | Description |
