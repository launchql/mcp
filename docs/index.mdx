# Getting Started with @hyperweb/mcp-server

Welcome to the documentation for the Hyperweb MCP Server (`@hyperweb/mcp-server`). The Hyperweb MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides seemless integration with Web3 tools in Hyperweb Ecosystem and Cosmos Ecosystem, enabling advanced interaction capabilities with AI agents for developers.

## Use Cases

The Agentic Tools MCP Server, also known as `@hyperweb/mcp-server`, provides a suite of functionalities focused on Cosmos SDK based chains and the broader interchain ecosystem. It allows for interactions with:

- **Interchain Kit**: Tools related to interchain standards and protocols.
- **Chain Registry**: Accessing and managing information about different chains.
- **InterchainJS**: Leveraging JavaScript libraries for interchain operations.
- **Starship**: Interacting with Starship, a unified deployment environment for Cosmos.

This server aims to simplify common developer workflows and provide programmatic access to essential data and operations within the Hyperweb and Cosmos environments.

## Prerequisites

Development:

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- pnpm (v10 or higher)

MCP server use:

- Any IDE or editor that supports MCP protocol, for example [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol), [Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp) or [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

## Usage with AI Clients (Cursor or Claude Desktop)

To integrate the Hyperweb MCP Server with AI clients like Cursor or Claude Desktop, you need to add the following configuration to your client's settings. This allows the AI client to discover and use the tools provided by this MCP server.

We will demonstrate the usage of the Hyperweb MCP Server with Cursor/Claude Desktop in this guide.

For more information, you can refer to the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol), [Windsurf MCP guide](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp) or the [Claude Desktop MCP guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

**Standard Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hyperweb-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hyperweb/mcp-server@latest"] // Make sure to use the latest version
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows Alternative Configuration:**

If you are on Windows, you might need to use this alternative configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hyperweb-mcp-server": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/k", "npx", "-y", "@hyperweb/mcp-server@latest"] // Make sure to use the latest version
    }
  }
}
```

After setting up the configuration, the MCP server will be available in the MCP clients (Cursor/Claude Desktop) and you will be able to interact with it through normal prompting.

The context will be detected and injected into the context of your conversation with AI agents and the tools will be available for use.

## Available Tools

This server provides a range of tools to assist with development in the Hyperweb and Cosmos ecosystems. For a detailed list of all available tools, their descriptions, and parameters, please refer to the [API Reference](./references).

Key areas covered by the tools include:

- Chain Registry interactions (`useChainRegistry`)
- Interchain Kit usage and migration (`useInterchainKit`, `migrateFromCosmosKitToInterchainKit`)
- InterchainJS usage and migration (`useInterchainjs`, `migrateToInterchainjs`)
- Starship environment setup and configuration (`setupStarship`, `generateStarshipConfig`, `verifyStarshipConfig`)

## Development

If you plan to contribute or modify the server:

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Build the project and copy prompts to build directory
- `pnpm clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm inspector` - Run the MCP inspector with the server
- `pnpm format` - Format code using Biome
- `pnpm lint` - Lint code using Biome

### Key Technologies

- **TypeScript**: For static typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **Biome**: For linting and formatting.
- **Model Context Protocol SDK**: For AI model interactions.
- **Zod**: For runtime type validation.
